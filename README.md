This project is a responsive pricing component built using semantic HTML and modular CSS. It features a mobile-first layout, dark/light theme toggle, and animated UI transitions.

Created as part of the building challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

---

## üîç Overview

The component includes a prominent title, value proposition, and a breakdown of pricing and benefits. The layout adapts across screen sizes with fluid media queries and uses CSS grid for structure.

To enhance accessibility and usability, it includes a skip link, WCAG-compliant contrast for both themes, and keyboard-friendly theme toggling. The design was closely aligned with the provided mockup using [PerfectPixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonecod/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi).
